## Installation
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*
The liabriaries we need:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Sklearn


## Project Motivation

If you're in Northern California, you'll be walking past the inevitable bushels of leafy greens, spiked with dark purple kale and the bright pinks and yellows of chard. Across the world in South Korea, mounds of bright red kimchi greet you, while the smell of the sea draws your attention to squids squirming nearby. Indiaâ€™s market is perhaps the most colorful, awash in the rich hues and aromas of dozens of spices: turmeric, star anise, poppy seeds, and garam masala as far as the eye can see.

In our business using your list of ingredients we can help you choose the dish and cuisine which you can make. 

1. Q1: What is the distribution of recipes in the data set? How the outliers look like?
1. Q2: What are the most common ingredients across all cuisines and in each cuisine?
1. Q3: What is an average number of ingredients per recipe in each cuisine?
1. Q4: What ingredients unequivocally point the cuisine?
1. Q5: Having the list of ingredients what cuisine the model will predict?


## File Descriptions
There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each part of the code is commented and there are markdown cells which were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There is also a training set and test set used to predict what kind of a cuisine it is based one the list of ingredients.

## Results
The main findings of the analysis can be found at the [post](https://medium.com/@agata.zarek/what-cuisine-for-todays-dinner-206e426a627d) available
